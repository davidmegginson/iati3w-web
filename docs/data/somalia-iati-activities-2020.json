The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  \nThe RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money. Before a contract is signed, a budget should be available in Atlas, hence this submission in GMS to secure funding.",

    "description": "Despite a favorable Deyr (October- December) rainy season, the lingering effects of the drought in 2018/2019, and flooding an estimated 1.3 million people in Somalia will be in Crisis (IPC Phase3) through mid-2020 without sustained humanitarian assistance. Currently, 4 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, out of whom 2.9 million are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and 1.1 million are facing Crisis or worse. Among the most vulnerable are 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) who remain highly impoverished. According to IOM, October 2019 report, Baidoa, the capital of Bay region, hosts one of the largest IDP populations in Somalia. According to figures compiled by the international community, as of September 2019, Baidoa had 359,994 internally displaced persons, consisting of 51,322 households on 435 sites.\n\nTherefore, looking into this precarious situation, the proposed project is designed to respond to the immediate lifesaving and life sustaining basic needs of poor and vulnerable displacement affected communities in Bay region. Project proposes three rounds of Multipurpose cash transfers to the most vulnerable displacement affected communities. Moreover, project will also provide cereal crops and vegetable seeds to displacement affected communities living in the off camp area. At the same time this we understand that as a result of locust infestation, beneficiaries pastoral and agro-pastoral communities are forced to migrate to other areas, therefore under this program NRC will be providing Fodder vouchers to the migrating communities. Support in the form of fodder vouchers will help communities to purchase fodder for their livestock during the time of migration. This cash injection will help benefiting households in accessing food and other unmet needs on immediate basis from the accessible markets. The monthly cash transfer amount will be as per the cash and market working group recommended transfer rate which will help beneficiaries to meet 80% of the full minimum expenditure basket. As a result of cash injection, affected households will have improved access to the diversified food and will positively contribute to the nutritional outcomes. \n\nProposed project is in line with the Food Security cluster strategic response objectives SO1: Improve households\u2019 immediate access to food through provision of conditional and unconditional cash assistance depending on the severity of food insecurity phases, vulnerability and seasonality of the livelihoods.\n\nAs soon as beneficiaries identification and  registration will be completed, NRC will be conducting a Baseline survey in order to have baseline values. After baseline, registered beneficiaries will be released monthly multipurpose cash transfer in line to the cash and market recommended transfer rates using electronic services of Harmuud. NRC team will be collecting post distribution monitoring (PDM) data two weeks after release of each round of cash transfer. As a standard practice, PDM captures some of the key information around timeliness of support, progress against critical indicators including \u2018Food consumption score (FCS) and Household dietary diversity score\u2019.

    "description": "The overall objective of the proposed project is that the food security situation of 865 vulnerable households (5160 individuals) in mostly rural communities in Zeylac district of Somaliland is stabilized and communities are more resilient towards adverse conditions.\n\nTo achieve the overall objective, the project offers: a) unconditional and b) conditional cash transfers for improved access to food. The project directly targets an estimated 5160 individuals ( mostly rural communities) particularly women, children and the elderly and other vulnerable persons in Casha Cado, Togoshi, Lawya cado, Sheikh Awaare and Zeyla villages. The project duration is 8 months to allow families to recover from adverse weather conditions and the potential desert locusts\u2019 threat. \n\nSpecifically, 565 households (HH) will receive Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCT) while 300 households will receive Conditional Cash Transfers. The cash transfers empower people with choice to address their essential and individual food needs, while also helping to boost local markets. Another reason for Candlelight to apply cash transfer are the reduced facilitation costs, as mobile transfers do require less administrative costs. The cash values to be transferred on a monthly basis are provided by the Cash Working Group (CWG) Somalia based on minimum expenditure basket (MEB) as per region across Somalia. The latest food cash transfer values for families in Awdal are USD 90 (October - December 2019)\n\nThe target group for the UCT will mainly be the rural and most vulnerable families facing high levels of food insecurity among other vulnerabilities. The timeframe for UCT to be disbursed will be 4 months to stabilize food security levels in the lean and Ramadhan seasons. The major activities for UCT will start with sharing selection criteria in a transparent manner with village leaders and communities. \n\nA local telephone company (Telesom) with extensive experience of conducting cash transfer to beneficiaries in remote areas will be commissioned to conduct monthly cash transfers to beneficiaries mobile phones. The beneficiaries who may not know how to use the services will be trained on how to use it. \n\nFor conditional cash transfers relating to Cash for Work (CfW) activities, the project will follow a similar selection and disbursement cycle. As part of CfW, the project will, village cleaning campaigns and rehabilitation/ replanting of mangrove forests especially in Toqoshi and Zeyla villages to provide for sustainable communal livelihood assets that enhance collective resilience. The individual sites for CfW activities will be identified together with the communities. The CfW beneficiary selection criterion will be their physical capacity in conjunction with the vulnerability of their families, such as families with more than three children, or families who lost major parts of their livestock and livelihoods. The families with men eligible for CfW might not be as vulnerable as the families receiving the UCT, however they have a risk of sliding into crisis mode. Beneficiaries shall be paid at a rate of approximately 7 USD each based on a standard piece of work but each beneficiary working for atleast 13 days in a month. Each 50 Cash for Work beneficiaries will be supervised by 1 foreman who will be paid a slightly high rate of approximately 10 USD each working day.",

    "description": "The proposed project will improve the food security of vulnerable communities in Abudwak through increased immediate access to food, protection of livestock assets and diversification of livelihoods by this majorly pastoralist community into kitchen gardening for a supply of nutritious vegetables and fruits. The 7-month project will be implemented in 10 villages in Abudwak. The project has two outputs. Output one will contribute to 400 food-insecure households (2400 people \u2013 1224 Male and 1176 Female) having immediate access to food through unconditional Cash transfer. Of these,  200 HH are IDPs located in Abudwaq town. \nOutput 2 targets 1,632 HH (9794 people) in the protection and restoration of their livelihoods for increased food and income sources. Of these, 900 HH will benefit from animal treatment meant to restore approximately 27,000 livestock to better health. This intervention will improve the livestock economic value as well as the value of meat and milk for household consumption. 6,000 additional and emaciated livestock will receive animal feed concentrate for a month to help them recover their health and increase production. The project will install a solar-powered pumping system to pump water from the Dalsan village borehole to the elevated village water tank which will then use gravity to distribute to the village water kiosk and livestock watering troughs that were constructed by NAPAD with funding from German-FFO. Over 430 HH in Dalsan will benefit from climate and economic friendly source of water for their livestock estimated to be 12,960. To increase household access to nutritious food 100 women will be supported to diversify into small scale kitchen gardening of vegetables and fruits. These women will be capacity built on kitchen gardening, supported with seeds and farming tools and mentored by NAPAD agronomist in establishing the kitchen gardens in their homesteads. The farms will be designed to ensure that the least amount of water is utilized in agricultural production. Women from the Dalsan village will especially benefit from the proposed solar water pumping system that will provide water to irrigate the kitchen gardens. Inagabille households and livestock will get their water from NAPAD constructed, G-FFO funded elevated 60,000 litres tank and animal troughs. These women will be capacity built on kitchen gardening, supported with seeds and farming tools and mentored by NAPAD agronomist in establishing the kitchen gardens in their homesteads.

Case tracing from health facility data with ensure the timely follow up and mitigation before outbreaks occur. \n\nThe project will deliver the Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS) to fill the critical maternal, reproductive, and child health service gaps and treat communicable diseases, common illnesses, HIV/STIs, and tuberculosis. Hygiene promotion activities will specifically reach households with sick and malnourished children through targeted and timely health and hygiene messages. At the four proposed static facilities, clinical staff have been trained on clinical management of rape (CMR), GBV referral pathways, psychosocial support (PSS), and data confidentiality. Each proposed health facility serves as an entry point to the connected women\u2019s and girls\u2019 safe space where vulnerable women and girls may, upon request, access PSS and referrals to specialized GBV services including CMR \n\nMultiple feedback channels will be established to ensure accountability and responsive programming. RI will communicate the availability of all feedback mechanisms and beneficiary right to share.

    "description": "Somalia has experienced recurrent droughts since 2011 which have been increasingly exacerbated by climate change. Agro-pastoralistsand pastoralists have been badly affected by the 2019 drought which has caused widespread crop failure, water shortages, and depleted livestock levels.\nMore than 4.2 million people were estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2019, and the number ofpeople who are food insecure is expected to increase in the coming months.  This year#s severe drought has been caused by abnormally hot, dry conditions during January-March and the failure of the rains in April-June. Most households are already adopting negativecoping strategies to mitigate food insecurity, including reducing food intake. Poor transportation and market infrastructure make it difficult for pastoralists to access markets, and there are few fed markets to provide animals with nutrition when natural pastures are inadequate. Over 80% of livestock was lost as a result of the 2017 drought, and the population of livestock herds, essential for pastoralists# food and income, have not yet recovered.\nThe impact of the 2019 drought on the water and sanitation sector has beensignificant. Water supply (boreholes, shallow wells) is severely limited and the cost of accessing water has increased sharply, representing a severe burden on insufficient household income. Existing groundwater sources contain a highly mineralized content, rendering it unsuitable for drinking, but a prior Oxfam needs assessment showed that the vast majority of households in the project area do not treat their water. Open defecation remains common, increasing protection risks for women and girls who venture outside alone or during the night or move far from dwellings to known open defecation areas.\nOxfam aims to assist at least 500,000 affected peoplewith immediate food security and WASH programming along with resilience and recovery interventions to diminish the impact of recurring droughts on vulnerable populations. Oxfam will embed activities to strengthen the protection of women, men, boys, and girls within the EFSVL and WASH workstreams.",

Agro-pastoralistsand pastoralists have been badly affected by the 2019 drought which has caused widespread crop failure, water shortages, and depleted livestock levels.\nMore than 4.2 million people were estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2019, and the number ofpeople who are food insecure is expected to increase in the coming months.  This year#s severe drought has been caused by abnormally hot, dry conditions during January-March and the failure of the rains in April-June. Most households are already adopting negativecoping strategies to mitigate food insecurity, including reducing food intake. Poor transportation and market infrastructure make it difficult for pastoralists to access markets, and there are few fed markets to provide animals with nutrition when natural pastures are inadequate. Over 80% of livestock was lost as a result of the 2017 drought, and the population of livestock herds, essential for pastoralists# food and income, have not yet recovered.\nThe impact of the 2019 drought on the water and sanitation sector has beensignificant. Water supply (boreholes, shallow wells) is severely limited and the cost of accessing water has increased sharply, representing a severe burden on insufficient household income. Existing groundwater sources contain a highly mineralized content, rendering it unsuitable for drinking, but a prior Oxfam needs assessment showed that the vast majority of households in the project area do not treat their water. Open defecation remains common, increasing protection risks for women and girls who venture outside alone or during the night or move far from dwellings to known open defecation areas.\nOxfam aims to assist at least 500,000 affected peoplewith immediate food security and WASH programming along with resilience and recovery interventions to diminish the impact of recurring droughts on vulnerable populations. Oxfam will embed activities to strengthen the protection of women, men, boys, and girls within the EFSVL and WASH workstreams.",

Thus far, MoPCA has implemented an awareness programs, which arenow broadcast on Radio and TV. The radio program has a wide coverage of people as it reaches almost all over the country. Furthermore, MoPCA has signed agreement with the Ministry of Education and Science as regards incorporating civic educationcourses into the curriculum of high primary schools, secondary schools and universities. The curriculum for the three preceding streams has been finalized recently and the teaching of the civic education is expected to begin soon.\nIn addition, MoPCA intends to train all government institutions to ensure that such institutions respect the constitutional rights of the citizens. The essence of the training of the government institutions on the constitutional rights is to enhance the protection of basic human rights and to strengthen the rule of law. So far, MoPCA has trained the Good Governance and Anti Corruption Commission as well as 1000 young men who were undertaking their National Service training at Dararweyne training school. The ministry also visited regional universities to train National Service girls who were attached to different universities to complete their national service requirements. MoPCA will continue training other government institutions on constitutional rights of the citizens.\nSimilarly, the Ministry has also distributed large quantities of the copies of the constitution as well as brochures and pamphlets aimed at raising citizens# awareness vis-\u00e0-vis their constitutional rights and their obligations as well. The ministry is also planning to visit regions and hold town-hall meetings with different citizens residing in regions. The aim of these town-hall meetings is to disseminate the constitution and to gather data as regards the views and opinions of society with respect to theirknowledge about their constitutional rights. MoPCA will also undertake consultative meetings in all regions.",

Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women's rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.\nOver the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions.

    "description": "Oxfam has been working in Somalia for over 40 years, working with Somali people and organisations implementing humanitarian, resilience and development programmes. Humanitarian response focuses on WaSH, EVFSL and Protection.\nOxfam has made a lot of gains through humanitarian resilience programmes which are likely to be eroded if the desert locust menace is uncontrolled. Oxfam will therefore capitalise and work with the existing community structures such as Early Warning Committees, Government line ministries, FAO and other stakeholders on the preventive and control measures.\nOxfam will prioritize safeguarding livelihoods focusing on cash intervention and locust control measures.\n\nA total of 1,056 people in coastal areas of Sool region will be reachedby the project and supported toprotect and recover their livelihoods.\n\nOxfam has vast experience in implementing conditional and unconditional cash transfer approaches in WASH, EVFSL programmes. The project will specifically focus on the Cash for Work(CfW) approach as it not only empowers individuals to spend based on their priority needs but also focuses on revamping community assets. CfW will therefore stimulate the recovery of the local economy by creating short-term work, reintroduce income flow,supporting local businesses through the purchase worktools while also encouraging households to purchase food and non-food items locally. The trench digging will involve large numbers of the population and will be designed to encourage the integration and participation of women and other marginalized groups in an area thus benefitting the entire community and not just a few individuals.\n\nThe project will support communities to address locust spread by burying them in trenches excavated through cash for work. A total of 1,056 people will dig 26 km of trenches and drive hopper bands through cash for work, this task will continue for 30 days, 15 days per month starting in mid-March 2020. This task is expected to minimize hopper bands probability to turn to dangerous swarm level while at the same time communities will be able to access cash to help them address food insecurity situation at household level.\n\nOxfam will closely cooperate with the Somaliland Ministry of agriculture",

Humanitarian response focuses on WaSH, EVFSL and Protection.\nOxfam has made a lot of gains through humanitarian resilience programmes which are likely to be eroded if the desert locust menace is uncontrolled. Oxfam will therefore capitalise and work with the existing community structures such as Early Warning Committees, Government line ministries, FAO and other stakeholders on the preventive and control measures.\nOxfam will prioritize safeguarding livelihoods focusing on cash intervention and locust control measures.\n\nA total of 1,056 people in coastal areas of Sool region will be reachedby the project and supported toprotect and recover their livelihoods.\n\nOxfam has vast experience in implementing conditional and unconditional cash transfer approaches in WASH, EVFSL programmes. The project will specifically focus on the Cash for Work(CfW) approach as it not only empowers individuals to spend based on their priority needs but also focuses on revamping community assets. CfW will therefore stimulate the recovery of the local economy by creating short-term work, reintroduce income flow,supporting local businesses through the purchase worktools while also encouraging households to purchase food and non-food items locally. The trench digging will involve large numbers of the population and will be designed to encourage the integration and participation of women and other marginalized groups in an area thus benefitting the entire community and not just a few individuals.\n\nThe project will support communities to address locust spread by burying them in trenches excavated through cash for work. A total of 1,056 people will dig 26 km of trenches and drive hopper bands through cash for work, this task will continue for 30 days, 15 days per month starting in mid-March 2020. This task is expected to minimize hopper bands probability to turn to dangerous swarm level while at the same time communities will be able to access cash to help them address food insecurity situation at household level.\n\nOxfam will closely cooperate with the Somaliland Ministry of agriculture",

    "title": "Desert Locusts Joint Response - Lead",
    "description": "The current locust crisis in the Horn of Africa is the worst outbreak of locusts in over 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia and the worst observed in over 70 years in Kenya. The situation rapidly deteriorated in January 2020 as weather conditions have been unusually conducive to the spread of the pest. These conditions will allow breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locusts, with the formation of large numbers of swarms. Desert locusts are expected to continue to breed and spread during the coming months. Given their life cycle, the March-April start of the long rains, coinciding with a regeneration of rangeland and the start of planting activities, will enable a new wave of breeding and further spread of the pest. Desert locusts have already reached northern Uganda, and looking forward, the infestation could: 1) spread further into the Rift Valley (especially in Ethiopia), as well as to South Sudan, 2) affect the 2020 main and secondary staple cropping seasons, and 3) continue to affect rangeland across the region. The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world as it is highly mobile and feeds on large quantities of any kind of green vegetation, including crops, pasture and fodder. A typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day. Even a very small, 1 km2 locust swarm (approx. 40 million desert locusts) can eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people. This can be especially devastating in areas where food security is poor and, where every gram of food produced counts towards minimizing gaps in a family\u2019s food consumption. Currently, the region faces widespread food insecurity. In Ethiopia, an estimated 8.5 million people are severely food insecure, Phase 3 and above, according to IPC between February and June 2020. In Somalia, from February to September 2020, the population in IPC Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. Drivers of this food insecurity include climate shocks, conflict, and macroeconomic crises. Ethiopia has been responding to the current swarm invasions since July 2019. To date, hopper bands have covered more than 429 km\u00b2 of the country. Two generations of breeding have caused large numbers of swarms to form and move to Kenya and Somalia. In January 2020, the swarms were also seen moving towards the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya\u2019s breadbasket. This would pose a serious threat, especially as Ethiopia already has an estimated 8.5 million people facing severe food insecurity. In Somalia, where 6.7 million people are now regarded as acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 2 and above), swarms bred in the north of the country and have moved mainly to central and southern regions. The pest is affecting pasture and threatening staple food crops in rural areas. Insecurity and a lack of national capacity have hampered control operations. The Somalia Food Security Cluster showed their findings in a presentation; the number of people affected was shown as over 2.5 million (21% of Somalia\u2019s population) and especially pastoralist, agro-pastoralist, riverine and IDPs are affected. COVID-19 In light of the global pandemic of COVID-19, on 25 March 2020, the United Nations launched a USD 2 billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). On 3 February, WHO also launched a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). The following responses, corresponding with a locust crisis response, must be accelerated or scaled up to achieve Strategic Priorities 2 and 3 of the Covid-19 HRP: - Food and nutrition assistance as well as rural livelihood support to food-insecure and malnourished people vulnerable to the infection particularly in countries experiencing food crises. - Scale-up of social assistance systems, and cash transfer programmes with complementary livelihood assistance (including adaptations for remote digital trade/marketing), particularly for rural crop and livestock workers and producers, small/medium businesses, refugees, IDPs, migrants and host populations, and other food-insecure population groups. The Somalia section of the Covid-19 HRP mentions under the most affected and at-risk population groups that the pandemic could also heavily impact vulnerable communities living in areas dealing with food insecurity and desert locusts, while Ethiopia section mentions that COVID-19 response will undermine efforts to combat desert locust infestations. While people\u2019s lives are threatened by the COVID-19 outbreak, the upcoming two agricultural production seasons are threatened by desert locust infestations. The number of COVID-19 cases reported in both Somalia (237) and Ethiopia (111) as of 20-04-2020 is still relatively low (also due to underreporting). Yet, the countries follow government restrictions and the response is designed with integrated COVID-10 measures.",

While there are so far only seven laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Somalia (first case: 16 March 2020), it must be noted there are no testing facilities and tests are currently sent to South Africa. Results are received after two weeks. The country has only 15 intensive care unit beds and ranks 194th out of 195 in the Global Health Security Index. Over a third of Somalis do not have enough clean, safe water to meet their daily needs, let alone for more frequent preventive handwashing. It goes without saying that an outbreak of COVID-19 in Somalia would have a devastating impact on vulnerable communities who already suffer from drought, conflict and most recently, locust invasion. 6.3 million Somalis are food insecure, 2.1 million internally displaced. The below activities would provide Oxfam Somalia and our partners with a top-up to the 50,000 GBP recently received through the CAT Fund.\nProject description / activities (including numbers to be reached):\nAn additional 100,000 GBP (50% as loan, 50% as grant) will enable Oxfam and our partners to scale up the WASH preparedness activities as well as support partner Shaqodoon on extending the COVID-19 helpline to Somalia#s Puntland State. Shaqodoon are currently in the process of completing the set-up of the helpline in Somaliland (with support from the current CAT Fund grant); to be launched by 11th April. The helpline in Puntland willfollow the same process as in Somaliland: Shaqodoon will develop the system and link it to a toll-free Coronavirus hotline providedby Puntland#s Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health will work closely with WHO and identify health personnel who will be trained in receiving and processing calls. Shaqodoon will provide pre-recorded health messages, on-site technical support and data analysis/dashboards for the Ministry.\n\nThe remaining amount will be utilised to scale up COVID-19 preparedness activities in Somaliland and Puntland, in collaboration with partners. Itwill also be used to top-up partners# crisis modifiers from other donors to make theircontribution in this fight, more meaningful. Activities include set-up of handwashing points in settlements, purchase and distribution of hygiene kits to IDP communities, dispatching mobile teams to disinfect busy public areas and purchase of HTH chlorine pumps for disinfection.\n\n50,000 people will be reached by Oxfam#s and partners# WASH COVID-19 preparedness activities.\nShaqodoon through the Ministry of Health of Puntland hopes to reach a majority of Puntland#s phone users with COVID-19 information sharing and prevention messaging.",

Toll-free Covid-19 helplines our partner Shaqodoon is running in the Ministries of Health in Somaliland and Puntland have been launched in mid-April and beginnning of May respectively. The call centres utilize an interactive voice response system providing up to date information related to Covid-19 to the community. People can call the hotline and receive WHO-approved pre-recorded messages on COVID-19, check symptoms, and also talk to a healthofficers if they wish to doso. They can also leave a voicemail and will be called back. The system can be accessed free of charge through mobile phones for callers using a 3-digit shortcode.\n\nThe Somaliland hotline has registered more than 651,366 calls so far (as of 19 May), highlighting the thirst of people across Somaliland for accurate and reliable information on Covid-19.  A number of risk cases have been identified through the helplines already, and people tested as a result of their call and guidance received. Shaqodoon is highlighting common misinformation on Covid-19 gathered through calls as well as stats on calls, follow-up and regional origin of callers on dashboards which support the Ministry of Health and humanitarian partners in addressing needs in a timely manner. They also produce weekly dashboards to provide the Ministry of Health with an overview of calls, levels of (mis-)information per region and necessary follow-up.\n\nThis project would support Shaqodoon in extending the helplineservice in collaboration with the Ministries of Health for another 2 months until June/July, reaching a majority of the population in Puntland and Somaliland (at least 60% of the population) with accurate and timely information, guidance and symptoms checking, while at the same time ensuring call center staff and Ministry of Health officials receive adequate protection and safe programming support to deal with sensitive data and critical cases.  Their work will be accompanied by the installment of innovative hands-free handwashing stations designed and produced in the TVET centres of partner Havoyoco. These measures will reach another 30,000 people across Somaliland.",

    "description": "In this part of the world where displacement and utmost poverty are prevalent with no properly\nfunctioning health systems, it is hard to imagine how adversely impactful a COVID-19 outbreak will be.\nPeople are already extremely vulnerable to bear yet another distressing crisis. While all countries need to\nrespond to COVID-19, countries with existing humanitarian crisis coupled with weak governance are\nparticularly vulnerable. When COVID-19 affects countries with protracted humanitarian crises like\nSomalia/land, vulnerable populations, particularly women headed households, the disabled and the\nelderly living in overcrowded camps or informal urban settlements will be highly vulnerable to the disease\nand its social and economic impacts unless support is given on preventative measures.The number of\npeople in need of humanitarian assistance in Somalia, around 5.2 million currently, will likely sharply\nincrease in the event of COVID-19 outbreak making the already fragile situation much worse. The Locust\ninfestation is another evolving crisis andif not addressed will also have significant impact on the food\nsecurity and livelihoods of the people.\nCOVID-19 crisis will have a different and far-reaching impact on poor people, especially the vulnerable.\nAnyone can be exposed to the virus but the poor are most vulnerable as they lack financial and social\nprotections. Overcrowded IDP settlements and poor urban slums are also going to be the places where\ndisease can spread easily and quickly. To effectively address the urgent and acute humanitarian dimension\nof the crisis, we need to frame that within our understanding of how inequality plays out. Women will be\nas susceptible to getting infected by the virus but their need for support is greater because, as in any crisis,\nwomen including elderly women, bear the greater responsibility of caring for the family and making both\nends meet. Women#s multiple burdens of needing to contribute to the household income while also taking\ncare of the young, theelderly and the sick mean they have the longest days, the shortest rest and the\nhighest stress, making them easy targets of disease.\nContainment measures and their economic fallout are likely to hurt more than the disease itself, and for\nlonger. Restrictions on movement and market access will affect many households# income and coping\nstrategies in Somalia/land, including households who were relatively well off before the pandemic. As well\nas short term support we need to consider howto provide support to those affected over the longer term.",

A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib's partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.\nIn the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women's rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.\nOver the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.",

    "description": "Oxfam has been working in Somalia for over 40 years, working with Somali people and organisations implementing humanitarian, resilience and development programmes. Humanitarian response focuses on WaSH, EVFSL and Protection.\nOxfam has made a lot of gains through humanitarian resilience programmes which are likely to be eroded if the desert locust menace is uncontrolled. Oxfam will therefore capitalise and work with the existing community structures such as Early Warning Committees, Government line ministries, FAO and other stakeholders on the preventive and control measures.\nOxfam will prioritize safeguarding livelihoods focusing on cash intervention and locust control measures.\n\nA total of 1,056 people in coastal areas of Sool region will be reachedby the project and supported toprotect and recover their livelihoods.\n\nOxfam has vast experience in implementing conditional and unconditional cash transfer approaches in WASH, EVFSL programmes. The project will specifically focus on the Cash for Work(CfW) approach as it not only empowers individuals to spend based on their priority needs but also focuses on revamping community assets. CfW will therefore stimulate the recovery of the local economy by creating short-term work, reintroduce income flow,supporting local businesses through the purchase worktools while also encouraging households to purchase food and non-food items locally. The trench digging will involve large numbers of the population and will be designed to encourage the integration and participation of women and other marginalized groups in an area thus benefitting the entire community and not just a few individuals.\n\nThe project will support communities to address locust spread by burying them in trenches excavated through cash for work. A total of 1,056 people will dig 26 km of trenches and drive hopper bands through cash for work, this task will continue for 30 days, 15 days per month starting in mid-March 2020. This task is expected to minimize hopper bands probability to turn to dangerous swarm level while at the same time communities will be able to access cash to help them address food insecurity situation at household level.\n\nOxfam will closely cooperate with the Somaliland Ministry of agriculture",

This request was based on Oxfam Novib's work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib's partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.\nIn the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women's rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.\nOver the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.",

    "title": "Desert Locusts Joint Response - Lead",
    "description": "The current locust crisis in the Horn of Africa is the worst outbreak of locusts in over 25 years in Ethiopia and Somalia and the worst observed in over 70 years in Kenya. The situation rapidly deteriorated in January 2020 as weather conditions have been unusually conducive to the spread of the pest. These conditions will allow breeding until June 2020 and could lead to 500 times more locusts, with the formation of large numbers of swarms. Desert locusts are expected to continue to breed and spread during the coming months. Given their life cycle, the March-April start of the long rains, coinciding with a regeneration of rangeland and the start of planting activities, will enable a new wave of breeding and further spread of the pest. Desert locusts have already reached northern Uganda, and looking forward, the infestation could: 1) spread further into the Rift Valley (especially in Ethiopia), as well as to South Sudan, 2) affect the 2020 main and secondary staple cropping seasons, and 3) continue to affect rangeland across the region. The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world as it is highly mobile and feeds on large quantities of any kind of green vegetation, including crops, pasture and fodder. A typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day. Even a very small, 1 km2 locust swarm (approx. 40 million desert locusts) can eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people. This can be especially devastating in areas where food security is poor and, where every gram of food produced counts towards minimizing gaps in a family\u2019s food consumption. Currently, the region faces widespread food insecurity. In Ethiopia, an estimated 8.5 million people are severely food insecure, Phase 3 and above, according to IPC between February and June 2020. In Somalia, from February to September 2020, the population in IPC Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. Drivers of this food insecurity include climate shocks, conflict, and macroeconomic crises. Ethiopia has been responding to the current swarm invasions since July 2019. To date, hopper bands have covered more than 429 km\u00b2 of the country. Two generations of breeding have caused large numbers of swarms to form and move to Kenya and Somalia. In January 2020, the swarms were also seen moving towards the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya\u2019s breadbasket. This would pose a serious threat, especially as Ethiopia already has an estimated 8.5 million people facing severe food insecurity. In Somalia, where 6.7 million people are now regarded as acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 2 and above), swarms bred in the north of the country and have moved mainly to central and southern regions. The pest is affecting pasture and threatening staple food crops in rural areas. Insecurity and a lack of national capacity have hampered control operations. The Somalia Food Security Cluster showed their findings in a presentation; the number of people affected was shown as over 2.5 million (21% of Somalia\u2019s population) and especially pastoralist, agro-pastoralist, riverine and IDPs are affected. COVID-19 In light of the global pandemic of COVID-19, on 25 March 2020, the United Nations launched a USD 2 billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). On 3 February, WHO also launched a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). The following responses, corresponding with a locust crisis response, must be accelerated or scaled up to achieve Strategic Priorities 2 and 3 of the Covid-19 HRP: - Food and nutrition assistance as well as rural livelihood support to food-insecure and malnourished people vulnerable to the infection particularly in countries experiencing food crises. - Scale-up of social assistance systems, and cash transfer programmes with complementary livelihood assistance (including adaptations for remote digital trade/marketing), particularly for rural crop and livestock workers and producers, small/medium businesses, refugees, IDPs, migrants and host populations, and other food-insecure population groups. The Somalia section of the Covid-19 HRP mentions under the most affected and at-risk population groups that the pandemic could also heavily impact vulnerable communities living in areas dealing with food insecurity and desert locusts, while Ethiopia section mentions that COVID-19 response will undermine efforts to combat desert locust infestations. While people\u2019s lives are threatened by the COVID-19 outbreak, the upcoming two agricultural production seasons are threatened by desert locust infestations. The number of COVID-19 cases reported in both Somalia (237) and Ethiopia (111) as of 20-04-2020 is still relatively low (also due to underreporting). Yet, the countries follow government restrictions and the response is designed with integrated COVID-10 measures.",

    "description": "TThe NGO safety program was established in 2004 to support NGOs operating in Somalia in terms of staff safety. In this complex context, NGOs face strong challenges related to access and security, including: a lack of understanding of the context difficulty to access and to verify information a lack of information sharing a lack of security coordination and harmonized security practices poor security awareness of staff and a lack of training opportunities. This safety platform is managed since April 2015 by INSO.\n\nIn response to and following the guidance of an Advisory Board (which is composed by 4 INGOs and 1 LNGOs), the project focuses on two main pillars of action which can be summarized as Information, Analysis and Advice, and Preparedness and Response. The two pillars are strongly interconnected: NGOs need accurate and timely security information to base their decisions on, while they need the proper safety training to organize and take relevant security decisions. Finally, in case an incident takes place, NGOs receive adequate support.\n\nThrough INSO\u2019s own network of Deputy Safety Advisors and Safety Advisor Assistants, NGO reports, collaboration with other security actors and media follow up, INSO collects, verifies, compiles and analyses security incidents. Besides, since 2010, the project has developed a database of more than 41,000 incidents that constitutes a unique tool for data analysis. The INSO field teams help NGOs on the ground to deal with daily security incidents, such as arrests, accidents and threats, while the INSO senior management team can provide support to critical incidents such as kidnappings, abductions, injuries and medical evacuations. The extent of INSO involvement is determined by the NGO who requests our services.\n\nDue to the peculiar mandate and mission of INSO, its Hargeisa office has a dual role, both as coordination hub and implementer of core INSO activities (such as roundtables, individual briefings, and production of maps and reports). Likewise, senior management (including the Country Director) are highly involved in the direct delivery of our services: they are not just managers but also direct implementers in their role as advisors to other NGOs. \n\nThe project budget leans heavily on HR costs because the project\u2019s core product is knowledge. That\u2019s in essence what INSO\u2019s beneficiaries receive. When the main output of an organization is information, the organization core cost is HR \u2013 same as e.g. an online newspaper or a management consulting firm.",

    "description": "A locust invasion in Somalia is threatening livelihoods as crops and vegetation for livestock foraging suffer extensive damage. According to the Somaliland National Disaster Preparedness and Food Reserve Authority (NADFOR) localized damage has been observed in Somaliland, where locusts have occupied a total of 100,000ha of Somaliland\u2019s coastal region including Woqooyi Galbeed. This has affected1,087,264 people, of which 22,853 are in IDPs camps. SC has observed the impact of the locust invasion to be most severe in Hargeisa Maroodijeh with 8,000ha of rangeland and 3,000ha of crop land damaged. In addition, Agabar and Arbasiyo villages in Gabiley districts have also been hard-hit with 1,000ha of damaged land. The Woqooyi Galbeed region was already characterized by significant food security gaps which is exacerbated by the desert locust crisis. According to the FSNAU technical release 153,000 people are food insecure (IPC 3 or 4) including 12,054 in Gabiley district and 139,134 in Hargeisa district. An SC survey showed that pastoralists are skipping meals or selling their remaining livestock for low prices to purchase food. There is also an increasing trend of labor migration at the critical time of Gu seasonal preparation. Only few actors respond to the locust crisis in this area including SOS and World Vision. Response gaps affirmed by the Food Security Cluster (FSC) monthly dashboard show 150,000 people need urgent Multi-Purpose Cash (MPC) support to protect access to food security. These include IDPs and pastoralists who have lost their livestock and have less than 6 goats. In addition to the locust crisis, Somalia is also at risk of an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Somalia reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on 16th March 2020 and currently has 60 recorded cases including 5 in Somaliland and 2 in Woqooyi Galbeed. Given the rapid pace of the virus and lack of access to testing kits, there are concerns that the number of cases will rise rapidly.",

UNICEF will distribute essential medicines, health kits (interagency emergency health kits and acute watery diarrhoea kits), vaccine and medical supplies. An estimate 40,000 under-one year-olds will be reached with age appropriate preventive vaccines, high-risk pregnant and lactating women with referral services and malaria prophylaxis.",

The Program complements Somalia\u2019s efforts to advance its development agenda (consolidate peace, accelerate reductions in poverty and income inequality, catalyze needed financing for transformative growth generating infrastructure). It consists of two broad components namely: (i) strengthening domestic revenue mobilization and public financial management; and (ii) advancing financial sector development. The operation has been designed in anticipation of Somalia\u2019s arrears clearance, a process being undertaken by the United Kingdom (UK). It takes into account the need for the Bank to step up its re-engagement with Somalia, post-arrears clearance, and to support the country\u2019s on-going economic and financial reforms. The implementation of the reforms being supported by the program is expected to lead to high, sustainable and inclusive growth for Somalia. This operation is strongly coordinated with those of the WB and IMF.",
